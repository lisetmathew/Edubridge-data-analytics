# ML Analysis on Heart Attack
## Objective:
To analysis the heart attack chance for people based on different scenario.

## About the Data:
The data contains several measurements like gender, age, heartrate, blood pressure and so on.

## Acknowledgement:
This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.

## Structure:
Importing the libraries and reading the data set

   • Importing libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.

   • Exploring the data set using different functions.

Exploratory Data Analysis

   • I used statistical analysis, grouping, extracting each columns.

   • Also used Pie chart, Barplot using seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the data.

Logistic Regression

   • Split the data into two, with one dependent variable and rest as independent.

   • Imported train_test_split, LogisticRegression, Confusion matrix, Classification report and accuracy_score

   • Checked the accuracy for train and test model

   • Plot the confusion matrix and find out the result.

## Conclusion:
Applying visualization provide more clear picture of the predicted and actual data of heart attack.
