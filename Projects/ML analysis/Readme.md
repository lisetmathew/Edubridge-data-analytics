# ML Analysis on Heart Attack 
## Objective:
To analysis the heart attack chance for people based on different scenario.
## About the Data:
The data contains several measurements like gender, age, heartrate, blood pressure and so on.
## Acknowledgement:
This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.
## Structure:
1.	Importing the libraries and reading the data set

    • Importing libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.

    • Exploring the data set using different functions.

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis

    • I used  statistical analysis, grouping, extracting each columns.

    • Also used Barplot and heatmap using seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the data.

3.	ML methods

    •	Split the data into two, with one dependent variable and rest as independent.

    •	Imported train_test_split, LogisticRegression,KNN, Decision tree, Random Forest, SVM, Confusion matrix, Classification report and accuracy_score

    •	Checked the accuracy for train and test model for each methods

    •	Plot the confusion matrix and find out the result.
## Conclusion:
Applying visualization provide more clear picture of the predicted and actual data of heart attack and the accuracy of the model is shown using different machine learning methods.
