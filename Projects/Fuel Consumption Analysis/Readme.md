# Fuel Consumption Rating Analysis
## Objective:
To analysis the fuel consumption of vehicles.

## About the Data:
Dataset provides model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada in 2022.

## Acknowledgement:
This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.

## Structure:
Importing the libraries and reading the data set

• Importing libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.

• Exploring the data set using different functions.

Exploratory Data Analysis

• I used statistical analysis, grouping, extracting each columns.

• Also used Barplot and line graph using seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the data.

ML methods

• Imported KMean clustering 

• ploted elbow graph

## Conclusion:
Applying visualization provide more clear picture of the data and we can find the vehicles having maximum and minimum fuel consumption,carbon dioxide emission.
